After adding the lowercase rule , this is what the url looks like.
http://localhost:8765/currency-exchange/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR
http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10


I want this to be achieved , we do it by configuring a custom route in here.

http://localhost:8765/currency-exchange/from/USD/to/INR
http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
http://localhost:8765/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/INR/quantity/10
